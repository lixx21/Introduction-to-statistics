# Pie Chart and Dot Plot

These 2 charts are used to visualize qualitative data such as color, car types, etc. there are advantages and disadavantages between these 2 charts:

1. it would be easier using dot plot if we want to compare frequencies of various categories
2. with pie chart, it would be very helpful to eyeball what fraction of the total a category corresponds to

# Bar Graph

we can use bar graph if the data is quantitative (i.e. numbers, then we should be put on a number line). This is because the ordering and the distance between the numbers convey important information

# Histogram Graph

this graph is similar with bar graph but, it allows you to use blocks with different widths. **The key point** of the blocks are proportional to frequency this means that the total are corresponds to 100%. Example if we want to figuring out what percentage of people fallen the age group from 60 to 80 we can see through the 60 to 80 block from the graph below.


and if we see the area for 60 to 80 group, we can say that the area is 1/7 of the total area and we can know the percentage **roughly 14%** of the people fall in to the range age 60 to 80. So we can figure out the percentage falling into a blcok without a vertical scale since the total area equals to 100%. But, sometimes it is useful for us to have the vertical scale or sometimes we called it as **density scale**. Its unit is '% per unit', so in the example above the vertical unit is '% per year'. The reason why this density sometimes useful because the area of the block corresponds to a percentage and the area is computed by width time height and since the width is given in years, the unit for the height needs to be percent per year in order for the units to work out

There are 2 kinds of inforrmation that we can get from histogram:

1. Density (crowding): The height of the bar tells how many subjects there are for one unit on the horizontal scalle. For example, the highest density is around age 19 as 0.4 = 4% of all subjects ar age 19. In contrast, only about 0.7% of subjects fall into each one year rage for ages 60-80
2. Percentages (relative frequencies): Those are given by Area = height x width. Remember that the area from this histogram corresponds to percentage and the area of the block is give by **height x width**. For example we want to know what percentage of people fall in age range between 60-80, about 14% of all subjects fall into the age range 60-80, because the corresponding area is (0.7% per year) x (20 years) = 14%. Alternatively, you can find this answer by eyeballing that this area makes up roughly 1.7 of total area of the histogram, so roughly 1/7 = 14% of all subjects fall in that range
